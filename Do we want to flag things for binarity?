All four data sets are estimated to contain binaries. The APOKASC-2 Catalog, Pinsonneault et al. 2018, and the APOKASC-3 Catalog, Pinsonneault et al. 2025, both contain known binaries. The rest of the data that is believed to be binaries are specific outliers that are noted as potential binary systems in the papers analysing said data. For example, stars that are estimated to be older than the universe could be the result of binary interactions. Following this logic, the majority of the stars in the data sets are not thought to be binary.  In order to fully consider binarity in our paper, we would have to first identify the stars likely to be binaries in each data set. For the APOKASC data, this has been done for us by Bufanda et al 2023. For the rest of the data, this could be done by analysing characteristics such as radial velocity and [C/N]–stellar mass relationships of outlier stars (Bufanda et al 2023.) Flagging for binarity is possible, however, I believe it is reasonable to ignore binarity and only consider it when analysing outliers in our results, as most of the stars we have data on are estimated to not be binaries.
